TypescriptLlvm
==================

Overview
---------

Typescriptllvm is a TypeScript frontend written in TypeScript for LLVM IR generation. For now, this work is mainly used for blockchain smart contract verification. Before we transpile Node.js code in Typescript into Javascript artifacts, Typescriptllvm combined with other backend analysis tools provides a powerful framework to search for vulnerabilities and security issues as smart contract developers would not realize while writing such smart contracts.
